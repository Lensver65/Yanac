	<title>British law requires platforms to take measures against illegal content</title>
	<description>Online platforms in the United Kingdom should take measures to prevent users from being confronted with illegal content and must remove it as soon as possible if exposed. They are required to assess their risk analysis before 16 March and implement concrete measures or have a plan. Offcom advises them to assess file sharing services for CSAM and write management programmes to prevent the spread of CSAM fathers through their services.
